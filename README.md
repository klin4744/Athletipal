# Athletipal

Athletipal is a TensorFlow project built directly on top of Google's PoseNet model demo which acquires real-time pose data. This project uses simple kinetic and potential energy calculations as well as relativity equations to estimate the total amount of calories a person is burning by movement in real-time.

To use this implementation of PoseNet, run the following commands:

In the posenet directory
yarn
In the posenet/models directory
yarn npm install npm run watch
