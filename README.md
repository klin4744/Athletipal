# Athletipal
<br>
Athletipal is a TensorFlow project built directly on top of Google's PoseNet model demo which acquires real-time pose data. This project uses simple kinetic and potential energy calculations as well as relativity equations to estimate the total amount of calories a person is burning by movement in real-time. 
<br>
To use this implementation of PoseNet, run the following commands: 
<br>
In the posenet directory
<code>
  yarn
</code>
In the posenet/models directory
<code>
  yarn
  npm install 
  npm run watch
</code>
